# pizero-noodling
repo for various unstructured stuff related to messing about with Raspberry Pi Zeroes

Stuff likely to get thrown in here soon:
* Simple internet access checker using a Pimoroni Blinkt
* Slightly more complex website checker using a Pimoroni Unicorn pHat
* Some examples of fiddling with a Pimoroni ScrollpHat
* config for a little powerpoint presenter gadget using a Pimoroni Skywriter for navigation
* wifi network scanner using no Pimoroni gadgets at all - just 2 wifi dongles, one of which can do monitoring
